/**
 * 'use client' marks where hydration begins — it does not keep this component
 * off the server. React still renders it during SSR, and DOMPurify has no DOM
 * there: calling it server-side threw "sanitize is not a function" and 500'd
 * every article page.
 *
 * So the body is sanitised twice against one shared allowlist in lib/sanitize:
 *
 *   1. a regex pass (sanitizeArticleHtml, no DOM) renders on the server, so the
 *      markup in the SSR payload is already filtered and crawlers see the
 *      article text rather than an empty div;
 *   2. DOMPurify's real parser re-sanitises it in the browser after mount, and
 *      is the authoritative pass.
 *
 * The upgrade happens in an effect rather than inline so the first client
 * render is byte-identical to the server's — the two sanitisers do not agree
 * character for character, and swapping the markup mid-hydration would be a
 * mismatch. Same null-until-mount shape the event components use.
