// Shown in place of the release list when the feed could not be fetched — as
// opposed to fetching fine and finding nothing, which keeps its own "no press
// releases" copy.
//
// The distinction matters: "this company has published nothing" is a claim
// about the company, and it is the wrong thing to tell a reader when the truth
// is that we could not reach the API.
//
// The placeholder rows are deliberately inert and few. This is not a loading
// skeleton — nothing is arriving — so it does not pulse, and it stops at three
// rows so it reads as "the shape of what is missing" rather than pretending a
// long archive is on its way.
