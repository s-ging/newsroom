//   /api/Companies/{id}/details  → socials only
// and then fills whatever is still blank from src/data/company-profiles.ts.
//
// This used to stitch in a third, /api/Articles/search, for tickers and the
// vendor quote codes. That endpoint returns 0 rows for every input including
// unfiltered (verified 2026-09-09), so it could only ever return null while
// costing a request on every company render. It is gone, the same way the dead
// legacy company feed was removed rather than left as a fallback that can only
// fail. `tickers[]` on the company record is the real source and carries the
// company's own listings rather than whichever exchange row happened to be
// attached to an article.
//
// `/details` is kept for one reason: it is the only source of the social links.
// Its established/listed/employees/address/phone/email fields came back blank on
// 10/10 companies sampled — the client does not supply that data — so those are
// read from `contacts[]` and the curated file instead, and are not chased here.
