//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR
// ACN publishes the same release in several languages. Today each translation
// is a separate article with its own id and no field tying it to its siblings:
//
//   108786  Jul 29 20:08  "ispace and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Agree to…"   (English)
//   108773  Jul 29 14:30  "ispaceと三菱重工、H3ロケットによる新ランダー「ULTRA」…"  (Japanese)
//
// The sidebar wants to offer those to the reader the way Businesswire does, as
// a row of language pills. We cannot build that from the data we get now.
//
// WHY WE ARE NOT GUESSING
// The obvious heuristic — same company, same day, different language — is wrong
// on real records:
//
//   * MHIEC Nagasaki: English published Jun 30 22:04, Japanese Jun 29 11:30.
//     Different calendar days, so a same-day match misses the pair entirely.
//   * Articles 108499 and 108500 share an identical publish timestamp and the
//     same company, but are two unrelated releases. A same-day match would
//     link them and tell the reader one is a translation of the other.
//
// A wrong link here is worse than a missing block: the UI asserts "this is the
// same release in Japanese", and readers act on that.
//
// WHAT THE BACKEND NEEDS TO PROVIDE
// Any one of these unblocks the feature; the first is the cheapest:
//
//   1. A `releaseGroupId` (or `parentArticleId`) on the article record, shared
//      by every translation of one release. Then this module becomes a call to
//      /api/Articles?releaseGroupId={id} and the guesswork disappears.
//   2. A dedicated /api/Articles/{id}/versions endpoint returning the siblings
//      directly — the shape below is what the UI consumes.
//   3. Failing both, `language` on every article plus the group id above; the
//      language alone is not enough.
//
// Whichever lands, replace fetchReleaseVersions() and delete this comment. The
// component already renders the populated state — see ReleaseVersions in
// components/features/article/ArticleSidebar.tsx.
